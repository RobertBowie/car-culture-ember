# Car-culture-ember

Car culture is an app for car enthusiasts looking for reliable, real world info on their vehicle.

  > Car Culture answers the question 'What next?'.  You tell the app a bit about your car and we dig through
our database of user experiences for the next major issues (or upgrades!) you should watch out for.  The more users
that are a part of Car Culture the more reliable and comprehensive our information becomes.
